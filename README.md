# IBM_test
IBM CIC chatbot

This chatbot is made by Jonas Koldkj√¶r as a hiring test for IBM CIC.
It is made in python, with no need for special libaries, it is intented to run in the consol, where the interaction with the chatbot is happening. There is a "hidden" feature when using the command "configure" which is designed only to be available for staff members, where a password is needed as the password is encoded in the source code, which is "IBM1234". If a question is asked (using an '?') the bot will save it to a list for further expedition. It is made from scratch as a fairly simple and easy to use bot, with only the necessary key features, and a little extra, but easy to add more features if needed.
